[When AI writes almost all code, what happens to software engineering?](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/when-ai-writes-almost-all-code-what)

## Why I Found This Interesting

I think this article does a great job of exploring how AI is changing the field of software development. It explains that AI is no longer just a tool that helps with small tasks, but is becoming capable of writing large portions of real, working code. This shift suggests that the role of a developer is moving away from simply writing code and more toward guiding, reviewing, and shaping what the AI produces.

I also found it interesting how the author emphasizes that developers will still be needed, but in a different way. Instead of focusing mainly on technical syntax, engineers will need stronger skills in system design, problem solving, and understanding user needs. The article highlights how the “human” side of development — like creativity, judgment, and responsibility — will become even more important as AI takes over more of the technical work.
