[When AI writes almost all code, what happens to software engineering?](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/when-ai-writes-almost-all-code-what)

## Why I Found This Interesting

I think this article does a great job of exploring how AI is changing the field of software development. It explains that AI is no longer just a tool that helps with small tasks, but is becoming capable of writing large portions of real, working code. This shift suggests that the role of a developer is moving away from simply writing code and more toward guiding, reviewing, and shaping what the AI produces.

I also found it interesting how the author emphasizes that developers will still be needed, but in a different way. Instead of focusing mainly on technical syntax, engineers will need stronger skills in system design, problem solving, and understanding user needs. The article highlights how the “human” side of development — like creativity, judgment, and responsibility — will become even more important as AI takes over more of the technical work.

### Luca Andreani (Landreani04) Comment
This article highlights the positives of AI while also explaining the reprecussions this has on certain job fields. I think that the idea of project manager and software engineer starting to merge is especially interesting as both jobs would require less work. However, while these do write glowing recommendations on the work AI produces, it also highlights how necessary it is for people to be fluent enough to read and understand the code produced. With AI producing full code, it's increasingly important to see where it does wrong and how to correct that yourself, without it's assistance. Overall, I like how the article balances the pros and cons of the new technology.
